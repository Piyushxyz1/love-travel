    <h1>Jim Corbett National Reserve</h1>
    <p>
      Honored with the title of a national park in 1936, Jim Corbett – The Famous Abode of the Tigers is Asia’s very first national park. However, the conservation of this land started way back in 1868, as it was the time when the British Forest Department excluded agricultural activities and operation of cattle station here. Since then, there is no looking back. In the initial days this park was named after Sir Malcolm Hailey, the Governor of United Provinces and thus, was popular as ‘Hailey National Park’. Later in 1954-55, it was called ‘Ramganga National Park’, as it covered the Ramganga River and the village.The saga doesn’t end here; within a short span of time it was again renamed as ‘Jim Corbett National Park’,so as to honor Edward James Jim Corbett-the man who contributed a lot to the establishment of the park. The conservation thus started, always saw an upward graph. In 1973, Corbett National Park stood as the first Tiger Reserve under Project Tiger – an initiative to protect the big striped cats.Today the Corbett National Park of India is one of the most visited wildlife destinations. Right from the tiger’s roar that gives you goose bumps, to the chirping of the birds that is like music to the ears. Wildlife at its best can be found flourishing in Corbett. The wild beings not only dwell here, they grow here.</p>

Tourists can throng the park in any period of the year as per its zones. Corbett features five distinct zones and each zone has a different topography with different visiting period.
</p>


<p id = "extra-text" style = "display: none;">
Jhirna Zone, which is 16 km away from Ramnagar, is a round-the-year tourist area of Jim Corbett National Park because of its dry topographical features. Similarly, Sitabani or Sonanadi Zone can be visited in any month of the year. Though this zone is not a part of Corbett in original terms and falls in Sonanadi Wildlife Sanctuary, which is situated just on the periphery of Corbett Park.
However if you want to access the core area of the park, i.e. Dhikala Zone then just schedule your trip in between 15th November till 15th June.  Enrich with pristine natural beauty, the zone is considered as the prime tourist area and remained close during rest of the year. Bijrani Zone remains active only during 01st October to 30th June while the visiting time of Durga Devi Zone, the farthest tourist region of Corbett from Ramnagar (25 km), is from 15th November till 15th June every year.

    <h2>
      Safari Timings
    </h2>
  
    <p>
    
  
  Explore the richness of Mother Nature at Corbett National Park with jungle safari tours and discover what makes this little gem a paradise for photographers, adventure seekers and wildlife lovers. A safari tour is the best way to come face-to-face with some fiery faces (tiger, jackal, wild boar and Himalayan bear) of the park.
  There are three types of safaris available in Jim Corbett National Park; Jeep Safari, Elephant Safari and Canter Safari. Among these, jeep and elephant safaris are the most common ones and are available for every zone of the park. But Canter safaris run only in Dhikala Zone, the core area of the national park. Also note that only those people can do jeep safari at Dhikala zone having permits to stay at the forest lodges situated at Dhikala zone.
    </p>
    
    
    <p id = "extra-text2" style = "display: none;">
    
      If staying outside Dhikala zone then canter safari is the only option to do safari at Dhikala zone.
Because of the varied topography and enormity of wilderness, safari timing in Corbett are mainly limited to sunshine period of the day only. The park normally opens at 6’o’ clock in morning and remains open till 11’o’ clock in morning while in the afternoon the park’s opening timing is 1430 to 1730. However the timings can be changed as per the season. So it is good to get the entire information from the forest officials.

    <h3>Safari Zones at Corbett</h3>
  
    <p><strong>Dhikala Zone</strong>: It is the main tourist and core area of the park. Situated on the edges of the valley Patli Dun, Dhikala Zone is dotted with picturesque natural vistas and is considered a good site to spot herds of elephants, chitals and deer as well as Bengal Tiger. It opens from 15th November till 15th June only.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Jhirna Zone</strong>: Lying at a distance of 16km from Ramnagar, Jhirna Zone is the most comfortable safari zone that opens throughout the year. The zone is mainly noted for its bamboo vegetation and wonderful bird watching experiences. Jhirna zone lies in the southern area of Corbett.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Bijrani Zone</strong>: Another notable zone blessed with enormous yet mixed topographical features. The entry gate to Bijrani zone is Amadanda. The chances of tiger spotting are more here in comparison to other zones. Bijrani zone remains open only during 01st October to 30th June.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Durga Devi Zone</strong>: Situated about 28 km away from Ramnagar, it is better to call Durga Devi Zone a tough challenge for visitors.
